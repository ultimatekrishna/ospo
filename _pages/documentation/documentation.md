# Overview

Despite widespread use, there are still many misconceptions and uncertainties for Allianz employees engaging in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common.
This website is therefore a guide, primarily for Allianz employees, on how to adopt, modify and release Open Source code. There are a few references to internal Allianz sites or services, but with an effort to limit our use of internal lingo or acronyms.

## Topics

* Using open source code: Policies on what to be aware of when adopting open source code in a Allianz project.
