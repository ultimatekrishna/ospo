# Using Libraries

Before including any open source library, the project should evaluate the library based on the following criteria:

* License: The license of the library should be permissive and compatible with our project's license.
* Quality: The library should be of high quality and have a good reputation in the open source community.
* Compatibility: The library should be compatible with Allianz preferred technology stack.
* Maintenance: The library should be actively maintained and have a community of contributors.

## Attribution

Correctly attributing open source licenses is important to respect the original author's rights and to comply with the license terms. When using an open source library, the project must include the license text in the project's documentation, readme file, or license file. Additionally, the project must attribute the library's author and provide a link to the original source code. If the license requires to include a copyright notice or a disclaimer, then this must done so as well.
